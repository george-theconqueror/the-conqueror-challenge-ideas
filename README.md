# Would You Rather - Challenge Ideas Ranking

A web application designed to help rank and prioritize future challenge ideas for The Conqueror Virtual Challenges platform using Elo rating system.

## Purpose

This app serves as a decision-making tool to determine which challenge ideas should be prioritized for development and launch. Users are presented with pairs of challenge ideas and asked to choose which one they prefer. Each selection updates the Elo ratings of the ideas, creating a dynamic ranking system that reflects community preferences.

## How It Works

1. **Pair Selection**: Users are shown two challenge ideas at a time
2. **Choice Making**: Users select their preferred option (left or right card)
3. **Elo Rating Update**: The selected idea gains rating points, the other loses points
4. **Dynamic Ranking**: Ideas with higher Elo ratings appear more frequently and are considered higher priority

## Features

- **Real-time Elo Updates**: Each selection immediately updates the rating system
- **Dynamic Queue**: Automatically fetches new idea pairs as needed
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
